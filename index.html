  <h2>This is not for everyone</h2>
  <p>
    This is not mass outreach or cheap lead lists.
  </p>
  <p>
    I only work with founders who want fewer, higher-quality conversations
    with decision-makers — and who are serious about converting them.

  <h2>Why founders work with Avendra</h2>
  <div class="grid">
    <div>
      <h3>Pay for outcomes</h3>
      <p>You only pay when qualified meetings actually happen. No retainers.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Founder-led execution</h3>
      <p>I personally design and run every campaign — no handoffs.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Highly selective</h3>
      <p>I take on a small number of clients to protect quality and focus.</p>

  <h2>About Patrik</h2>
  <p>
    I run Avendra Partners as a solo, founder-led operation focused on
    performance-based outbound for B2B SaaS and tech.
  </p>
  <p>
    I don’t sell theory, templates, or retainers — only results. If we’re not a
    fit, I’ll tell you upfront.

  <h2>What founders say</h2>
  <div class="testimonials">

      Clear process, no fluff.”  
      <span>— SaaS Founder (EU)</span>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      “Finally an outbound setup where incentives are aligned.

  <h2>FAQ</h2>
  <div class="faq">
    <p><strong>Is this cold email?</strong><br>
    No. It’s multi-channel outbound focused on relevance and fit.</p>

    <p><strong>How fast do results come?</strong><br>
    Typically within 7–10 days after alignment.</p>

    <p><strong>What markets do you cover?</strong><br>
    Primarily Europe-based B2B SaaS and tech.</p>

    <p><strong>Do you work with everyone?</strong><br>
    No. I’m selective to protect performance.</p>
