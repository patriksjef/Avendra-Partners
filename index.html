  <h2>This is not for everyone</h2>
  <p>No mass outreach or cheap lead lists. I only work with founders who want fewer, higher-quality conversations with decision-makers — and who are serious about converting them.</p>

  <h2>How it works</h2>
  <ol class="steps">
    <li>We define your ICP, offer and positioning together</li>
    <li>I launch targeted multi-channel outbound (email + LinkedIn)</li>
    <li>Interested prospects book directly into your calendar</li>
  </ol>
  <p class="highlight">
    You only pay when meetings actually happen and prospects show up.
