  <h2>This is not for everyone</h2>
  <p>
    Avendra Partners is not a fit if you’re looking for cheap leads, mass outreach,
    or fully automated “spray and pray” campaigns.
  </p>
  <p>
    I only work with founders where outbound makes strategic sense and quality matters
    more than volume.

  <h2>Why founders choose Avendra</h2>

  <div class="grid">
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Aligned incentives</h3>
      <p>
        You only pay for meetings that actually happen.
        No retainers. No setup fees. No long contracts.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Founder-led execution</h3>
      <p>
        I personally build and run every campaign.
        No hand-offs to junior SDRs or agencies.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Highly selective</h3>
      <p>
        I work with a small number of clients at a time
        to maintain quality and focus.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Europe-focused</h3>
      <p>
        Experience running outbound across multiple European markets
        in B2B SaaS and tech.

  <h2>How it works</h2>

  <ol class="steps">
    <li>Define ICP, offer and positioning</li>
    <li>Launch targeted outbound campaigns</li>
    <li>Qualified prospects book directly into your calendar</li>
  </ol>

  <p class="highlight">
    Simple rule: if the meeting doesn’t happen, you don’t pay.

  <h2>About me</h2>

  <p>
    I’m Patrik — a founder-led outbound operator focused on helping
    early-stage B2B SaaS teams build predictable pipeline without upfront risk.
  </p>

  <p>
    I don’t run high-volume systems or outsource execution.
    Every campaign is built manually, tested carefully,
    and optimized based on real conversations — not vanity metrics.

  <h2>FAQ</h2>

  <div class="faq">
    <h4>Is this cold email?</h4>
    <p>
      It’s multi-channel outbound focused on relevance and fit —
      not mass cold email blasts.
    </p>

    <h4>What markets do you cover?</h4>
    <p>
      Primarily Europe-based B2B SaaS and tech companies.
    </p>

    <h4>How fast can I expect meetings?</h4>
    <p>
      Typically within 7–10 days after alignment.
    </p>

    <h4>Is there any upfront cost?</h4>
    <p>
      No retainers, no setup fees — you only pay per meeting that happens.
